digger-winapi
=============

an unfinished implementation of digger using winapi

It doesn't have AI (just some basic function for opponents to stay on ground),
collected gold is counted but not displayed anywhere.

I do not plan to improve it anymore, as everything should be rewritten.
As I can imagine, everything should be saved in nodes, A* pathfinding algorithm
is needed for enemies, normal menu, level editor, highscores and so on and so forth.
